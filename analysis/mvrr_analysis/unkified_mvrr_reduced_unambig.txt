The woman given the sandwich from the kitchen fell in the dining room
The convict taken into the dark cell tried to escape but failed
The prisoners beaten for hours and hours confessed to crimes they never committed
The business grown into an empire was sold for billions of dollars
The mice consumed rapidly and entirely were carrying a rare bacteria
The lawyer committed to keep silent was discovered to have broken his promise
The child forgotten in the chaos found her way back home
The horses taken past the barn fell into a swamp
The artist drawn a impressionist portrait was impressed with the work
The car driven into the parking lot crashed into a concrete wall
The campaign known to be very popular was still unsuccessful
The student written a carefully worded excuse forgot to give it to the teacher
The television show begun three weeks ago was canceled immediately
The boys done an unsolicited favor appreciated the person who helped them
The player thrown the baseball dropped it on the ground
The child led past the swings was upset about it
The students gotten a fancy dinner ate the meal quickly
The infant aroused during the night yelled intensely
The refugee hidden in the basement departed during the night
The dog seen on the beach UNK-LC-ed after a bird
The ship blown off course sank in the storm
The fans UNK-LC-ed at the concert took photos with their phones
The boat sunk in the sea disappeared in the storm
The couple shown the apartment moved to a different city
The girl given a new blanket lost it during the trip
The airplane flown in the mountains broke down during the ice storm
The child borne down the hall yelled at the top of his lungs
