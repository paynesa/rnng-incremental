## Probability Distribution Analysis

Analyzes information about the probabilistic distribution of the Penn Treebank-based 
model found in `first action`, which contains the probability distribution of the first action
taken after the target word, `second action`, which contains the probability distribution of the 
second action taken after the target word, and `shift action`, which contains the probability
distribution at the time `SHIFT` is called to push the target word onto the stack.
